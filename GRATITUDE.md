# Thank you.
A project like Data Concierge AI (Concierge) would not come to be without an immense amount of help.

It would be the height of arrogance to release such a project without listing those who helped make this happen. Future versions of Concierge likely will have periodic updates to this file… it just feels like the right thing to do.

There’s a lot of work to do. Let’s get to it. Together.

## The open source community:
Concierge is built on 100% open source software (OSS). While the license models of various components do have differences, the goal is the same. The highest quality software freely available for experimentation, exploration, and collaboration. Concierge (just as most other software in this space) would not be able to exist without this foundational work. To honor this spirit of freedom, Concierge will always have a 100% free and OSS version. Always.

Special recognition to the [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/), [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/) communities. Your tech stacks are great, but it’s the ecosystem of boisterous support that makes it a joy to be working in this space.

## Dave Hoelzer:
Your talk at SANS CDI 2023 hit me at the right time. Several ideas I had brewing clicked. I also appreciate how freely you assisted me in getting a version of your script running. You’re a class act, and I always appreciate how you challenge others to reach just a little further.

## Our clients:
[InfoSec Innovations](https://infosecinnovations.com) (ISI) is a business. We wouldn’t be able to afford the sort of research and development time needed to create a project like this without our clients’ support through other consulting engagements and services. We at ISI owe our very existence to you, so thank you.

Though our policies prevent publicly naming clients, I would be remiss if I didn’t at least cryptically mention the two organizations who helped us better understand how Concierge can be more useful and less difficult to start using. You know who you are. Thank you.

## You:
If you’re reading this, you have the opportunity to help shape this project in a way that likely will shock you. If you’re able to sling code, please head directly to the GitHub issues and assist with development requests. But this project is more than just coders… we’re all about you, the user. It sounds odd saying it, but software without users is pretty useless. We need this project to be anything but that! Plainly put, we need your feedback. Please let us know what you like, what you dislike, anything. Thanks in advance… future versions of Concierge will be based on this crucial input.

## My crew at InfoSec Innovations:
I’m so glad you’ve chosen to work with ISI. I do not have the eloquence needed to adequately state my appreciation. I cannot wait to see what’s next on our nearly limitless future path.

## My wife:
Concierge started as a curiosity and almost turned into a pathological obsession. You kept me grounded while urging me on at a sustainable pace. Your loving support means everything.
